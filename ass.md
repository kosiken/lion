# CEN 511 Edsim assignment

Hi everyone, how is your december going, I hope its going better than
New york Knicks fans. Seriously imagine supporting a club thats so
hopelessly tied to mediocrity that you can literally feel hope
leaving you as you are watching, it's quite dreadful. Enough said
about basketball while a lot of us would rather have their holiday go like this

_Mr Okereke_ and the others imagined it going like this

![code](./undraw_code_review_l1q9.png)

There's an igbo proverb that says _O rie ka osi erie, ihe o koo koo_ which translated to english means
absolutely nothing useful, I don't even know why I brought it up. So in the spirit of
doing things for no reason I decided to share this to guys incase we are having any issues doing it
or if we have lost our sanity trying to figure out how to send #0EH to the LCD module ðŸ˜¡.

## Issues

If you want further explanation on the code you can ðŸ“¨ message me and hopefully we can solve them
together or if you just want to dash me like 10k you can ðŸ“±call me or what the heck lets just skip
to the ðŸ’° money **0069471301**

## Theory

> If you just want the code you can just scroll down

Your Edsim simulates the communication between the 8051 and the Hitachi HD44780U (LCD-II) Dot Matrix
Liquid Crystal Display Controller/Driver, what the hell is the HD44780U? I told you you could skip
that's your problem. Anyway the LCD module has 2 modes

| Mode       | Function                                                            |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 4 bit mode | You send data higher nibble first then clock edge then lower nibble |
| 8 bit mode | You send data in full bytes                                         |

And has the following input pins, ok this is too complicated to write, just read [here](http://www.circuitstoday.com/interfacing-16x2-lcd-with-8051), the edsim examples and the HD44780U [documentation](https://www.edsim51.com/8051simulator/HD44780.pdf)

## Disclaimer

While I vouch for the validity of this code let me state the following

- It may malfunction if your name is longer than 15 letters eg _Chinecherem_ or **Chinazamekperenkeoma** or
  [Srivaddhanaprabha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vichai_Srivaddhanaprabha)
- If your matric is longer than 15 something is wrong with you
- This is guarnteed to work only under these settings

## Code

```asm

; This is the assignment code given to us
; it is done in 4 bit mode so to work it input your matric no followed by '-'
; not "'-'" just '-' and then your name
; like so -> 15CJ02800-ALLISON


	CLR SM0			; |
	SETB SM1			; | put serial port in 8-bit UART mode

	SETB REN			; enable serial port receiver

	MOV A, PCON			; |
	SETB ACC.7			; |
	MOV PCON, A			; | set SMOD in PCON to double baud rate

	MOV TMOD, #20H		; put timer 1 in 8-bit auto-reload interval timing mode
	MOV TH1, #-3		; put -3 in timer 1 high byte (timer will overflow every 3 us)
	MOV TL1, #-3		; put same value in low byte so when timer is first started it will overflow after approx. 3 us
	SETB TR1			; start timer 1
	MOV R1, #20H		; put data start address in R1
again:
	JNB RI, $			; wait for byte to be received

skip:

	JMP again			; jump back to waiting for next byte
new:
  CJNE A, #0DH, skip	; compare it with 0DH - it it's not, skip next instruction
	JMP finish			; if it is the terminating character, jump to the end of the program

I hope this document finds you in good terms and I beseech you to have a
wonderful christmas. Beseech what does it even mean and why was Apostle Paul
always beseeching people
